		<p>Welcome to DCSD for students. This is where you go to find out what real students think of their teachers at school. The district can do all the evaluation it wants, but in the end it's the students' opinions that truly reflect what a teacher is like. If you are a student and want to write a review on a teacher that you've had, or if you just want to see what other people are saying about teachers, click below. Try not to rant or hate too much.</p>
